## Belly Button Biodiversity

For this experiment, we took data from each volunteer's naval. The data found includes a list of bacteria cultures found inside the naval (or bacterial species), the frequency of washing the belly button, and how much of each bacteria culture was found, i.e. the sample value of the bacterial species (also known as OTUs). To collect this data, each volunteer is given a test subject number associated to their personal data. On the webpage displaying a summary of this information, you can select the ID number and view their demographic information, top 10 bacteria cultures found, the washing frequency, and a bubble chart displaying the number of cultures per sample.

## Overview of Project

- The project was to create three visualizations - a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart - in javascript using the JSON sample data. Then, customize the dashboard using HTML and Bootstrap to make the webpage visually appealing and clear for the user how to interpret the drop down menu and/or the data given on the page.
- Note: Different colors, sizes, styles, and fonts of the information and visualizations can be adjusted for better viewing based on preferences.

## Results

The results can be seen on the HTML page that has been deployed to GitHub Pages: https://kmaluccio.github.io/plotlydeploy/
